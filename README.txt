This workspace consist of a similarly structured CSS design since I copy-pasted from templates.
I know it is my problem, but I should have [beforehand] created my own design before applying all functions into my code.
I apologize because I am also having a hardtime figuring out how to edit or breakdown the already built design.
I will do better next time, Sir. Pamasko niyo na lang po sa akin hahaha thank you for your patience once again.

It has all functions, I thoroughly watched every video. The only problem here is the search function, just because I feel
like I have no time to add it into my work. But I do understand how to add it and will surely use it for my future codes. (search function)

I wished to add imgs to the code but I coulnd't figure out how.
I tried adding

	<body style="background-image: <?= site_url("wallpaper.jpg") ?>;">

But to no avail.

Anyway thank you for being patient at teaching us, Sir. I am enthusiastic about creating websites because it's been part of my life since I 
was a a teenager and seeing that I can make things come to life and a webpage eye-pleasing makes me proud and at the same time happy.

That is all.
